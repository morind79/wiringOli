MCP2515 is using SPI and you should enabled it.
Kernel must be compiled using the following instruction :

1 - Copy file to drivers/spi/spi-sun7i.c
2 - Add in the Makefile : 
obj-$(CONFIG_SPI_SUN7I)			+= spi-sun7i.o
3 - Update Kconfig :
config SPI_SUN7I
	tristate "SUN7I SPI Controller"
	depends on ARCH_SUN7I
	help
		Allwinner Soc SPI controller,present on SUN7I chips.

config SUN7I_SPI_NDMA
        bool "SUN7I SPI Normal DMA mode select"
        depends on SPI_SUN7I
        help
          This selects SPI DMA mode with DMA transfer
          Y select NDMA mode and N select DDMA mode
4 - Add SPI support
5 - Add also CAN/MCP2515 support
