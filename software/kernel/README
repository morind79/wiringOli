MCP2515 is using SPI and you should enabled it.
Kernel must be compiled using the following instruction :

1 - Copy file to drivers/spi/spi-sun7i.c
2 - Add in the Makefile : 
obj-$(CONFIG_SPI_SUN7I)			+= spi-sun7i.o
3 - Update Kconfig :
config SPI_SUN7I
	tristate "SUN7I SPI Controller"
	depends on ARCH_SUN7I
	help
		Allwinner Soc SPI controller,present on SUN7I chips.

config SUN7I_SPI_NDMA
        bool "SUN7I SPI Normal DMA mode select"
        depends on SPI_SUN7I
        help
          This selects SPI DMA mode with DMA transfer
          Y select NDMA mode and N select DDMA mode
4 - Add SPI support
5 - Add also CAN/MCP2515 support
[*] Networking support --->
....<M> CAN bus subsystem support --->
........<M> Raw CAN Protocol (raw access with CAN-ID filtering)
........<M> Broadcast Manager CAN Protocol (with content filtering)
............CAN Device Drivers --->
................<M> Platform CAN drivers with Netlink support
................[*] CAN bit-timing calculation
................<M> Microchip MCP251x SPI CAN controllers
................[*] CAN devices debugging messages

....Device Drivers --->
........[*] SPI support --->
............<M> BCM2798 SPI controller driver (SPI0)
............<M> User mode SPI driver support
.......-*- GPIO Support --->
............[*] /sys/class/gpio/... (sysfs interface)
