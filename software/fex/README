Original script file (named script_original.bin) has been adapted to do the following :

1 - Add serial port

UART0 -> Console port ttyS0 (unchanged), 12v serial lines on COM1 port
UART2 -> Enabled, now ttyS1, used in EnergyMeter port
         This port is using line PI18=TX and PI19=RX on UEXT2 pin 7 and 8 respectively.
UART4 -> Enabled, now ttyS2, used for serial external device (3.3v=P5 connector or 12v=COM2 serial lines)
         This port is using line PG10=TX and PG11=RX on GPIO-1 pin 25 and 26 respectively. 
UART6 -> ttyS3 (unchanged, just tty number changed), used for SIM900
UART7 -> ttyS4 (unchanged, just tty number changed), used for XBee

2 - Disabling SPI1

Because UART2 is using same pin as SPI1, SPI1 has been disabled.

3 - Activating CAN via MCP2515 (interruption on PI14=gpio_pin_13)

Also kernel should be compiled to support MCP2515, please see kernel compilation.

New script.bin and script.fex files are the one with these changes.
